//! Link-time shim that re-activates the OHOS picker grant without the callers
//! knowing about it.
//!
//! OHOS grants the app read/write access to the directory tree the user picked
//! in `DocumentViewPicker` and remembers that grant across restarts, but every
//! new app start has to re-activate it before the paths below it are reachable
//! again. Doing that from application code means every file-using crate needs
//! an OHOS-specific call - the thing this shim removes.
//!
//! Instead it intercepts the path-taking libc entry points. Each wrapper runs
//! the real call first and only when that call fails does it derive the URI
//! from the path and activate the grant, retrying once when that activation
//! succeeded. Callers observe either the original result or a retried one, so
//! no OHOS-specific code is left on their side.
//!
//! Only a genuine authorization failure is worth that round trip: a path under
//! the sandbox is always reachable, and a missing file stays missing however
//! often its grant is activated. Each wrapper therefore checks both the `errno`
//! the real call set and the path prefix before acting.
//!
//! Wired up by this crate's build script through `-Wl,--wrap=<symbol>`. That is
//! a link-time binding: every undefined reference to `<symbol>` inside the final
//! `libcore.so` is redirected to `__wrap_<symbol>` here, while the real
//! implementation stays reachable as `__real_<symbol>`. Unlike `LD_PRELOAD` this
//! does not depend on the runtime symbol lookup order, and it covers the app
//! process itself - a preload only reaches the processes we spawn ourselves.
//!
//! `syscall` is wrapped as well as the individual entry points, so a path-taking
//! call that reaches libc through `syscall(SYS_openat, ...)` rather than through
//! the dedicated wrapper is still covered.
//!
//! rustix is not covered here, and does not need to be. On OHOS it keeps its
//! linux_raw backend, which issues syscalls through inline assembly and never
//! touches a libc symbol, so no link-time redirection can see it. Every path
//! warp opens under the user-public prefix goes through libc instead - `std::fs`,
//! `walkdir`, `ignore` and the `notify` watcher - while rustix only reaches this
//! binary as a leaf of `async-io`/`tempfile`/`fs4`/`xattr`, which work on file
//! descriptors or on sandbox paths. Moving rustix to its libc backend is not an
//! option: rustix 1.x has no OHOS support there, and `target_env = "ohos"` falls
//! into its glibc branch and fails to compile against the OHOS libc.
//!
//! Activation applies to a whole directory tree, so once it succeeds every
//! later access below that directory goes straight through the fast path and
//! never reaches the activation code again. No cache of activated paths is
//! needed for that - the success of the real call is the cache.
//!
//! Nothing here logs. The shim is meant to be invisible to the code it
//! forwards, so it adds no output of its own on any path.
