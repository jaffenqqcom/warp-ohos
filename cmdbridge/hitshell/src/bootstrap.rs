//! SSH bootstrap over the fixed-key management listener (127.0.0.1:40230).
//!
//! Connects to the daemon's management port with the fixed management keys,
//! authenticates, sends the reserved `BOOTSTRAP_COMMAND` command, and reads the
//! returned `SshInfo` (this run's dynamic command host key + client private key
//! + command port). When the daemon restarts its dynamic keys change, so this loop
//! re-fetches periodically and hands the pool a new config only when something
//! changed. Runs on a dedicated thread (never on a host-application/GPUI calling thread).
//!
//! The connection is held open for as long as this loop runs, and each round
//! sends the request over it instead of over a fresh connection. Its presence is
//! what tells the daemon this instance is still there: the user name it
//! authenticates with names this instance, so while the connection is up the
//! daemon leaves this instance's process trees alone, and when it ends -- which,
//! on a loopback connection nothing else ever closes, means this process is
//! gone -- the daemon takes them down (see the daemon's `peers`).
//!
//! Nothing here may close that connection while this process lives, and it
//! carries no keepalive: a keepalive left unanswered while the process is frozen
//! by the system would drop the very connection whose presence says the instance
//! is alive. Its rekey bounds are long for the same reason -- see
//! `pool::REKEY_TIME_LIMIT`.
