//! SSH connection pool to the daemon's command listener.
//!
//! A single multi-threaded tokio runtime is shared by the pool thread and every
//! command's pump task. The pool thread keeps at least MIN_IDLE ready
//! connections (each an authenticated russh Handle); `allocate()` pops one with
//! a bounded wait. When the daemon restarts, its dynamic keys change and the
//! bootstrap swaps the config and clears the ready pool so in-flight commands
//! fail explicitly and re-establish against the new keys.
//!
//! The pool thread is started by the bootstrap the first time a config arrives,
//! never before: until the management channel has answered once there is nothing
//! the pool could connect to, so a daemon that was never reached costs neither a
//! thread nor a connection attempt. It then stays up across daemon restarts, and
//! is disabled -- config and ready connections dropped -- whenever the
//! management channel is lost, since with the channel gone its keys are stale.
//!
//! A pool built by [`Pool::new_terminal`] keeps no ready connections at all: it
//! never starts the pool thread and establishes one connection per acquisition.
//! Its callers serve a single interaction -- the interactive shell bridge holds
//! one pty for the life of its process, and a `-c` run serves one command -- so a
//! ready stock would open connections nobody ever pops, and the handshakes
//! filling it would contend with that interaction's own.
