//! Backend-agnostic remote command execution contract, self-contained.
//!
//! This crate intentionally carries its own copy of the executor contract
//! (`ExecSpec` / `RemoteChild` / `FdMode` / `Signal` / `RemoteCommandExecutor`)
//! instead of depending on the `command-executor` crate (DESIGN.md section 2:
//! hitshell is self-contained and depends on no other gpui_ohos crate). The
//! type names and shapes mirror `command-executor` so `util::command::ohos`
//! only has to swap its import source.
