// Host-compatibility preload for the Node.js processes the daemon spawns.
//
// The daemon preloads this file via `NODE_OPTIONS=--require ...` on every child
// it spawns, whatever the child turns out to be.
//
// Keep this the ONLY preload file. Every host workaround belongs in here, in
// its own labelled section below -- do not add a second shim, and do not split
// these patches across files. One file means one `--require` to materialise,
// keep in sync on the device, and reason about when a Node process misbehaves;
// a second file makes all three worse for no gain. The file is named for what
// it is, a shim, rather than for the first bug it happened to fix.
//
// Each patch below is written to be a no-op wherever the host already behaves
// the way the tools expect; a patch only steps in on the departures described
// directly above it. Keep that property when adding one: a preload that fires
// changes the behaviour of every Node process in the session.
//
// The same preload also runs on a mainstream Linux host, where none of these
// departures exist and every one of these substitutions would be wrong. A patch
// therefore has to establish at run time that it is needed, by one of:
// - a condition only this host can meet -- the platform name as it was before
//   this file rewrote it, or a tool that is actually on PATH;
// - a probe of the capability in question, so an error a mainstream host can
//   also produce (a name that is taken, a tree that is read-only) is handed
//   back to the caller exactly as the real call reported it.
// Never substitute on the strength of this being the host under test.

// symlink(2) is refused by the filesystem the install tree lives on
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// npm materializes each entry in `node_modules/.bin` as a symlink pointing at
// a file inside its package, and the tree is written to a filesystem that
// refuses links outright -- every such call fails, and the install fails with
// it. The entries are not optional: the host application launches npm-hosted
// language servers as `node <entry>`, and `npm run` executes them.
//
// The real call is attempted first, so this patch is a no-op wherever links
// are allowed; it only steps in once the filesystem has refused. A refusal on
// its own is not enough to go on, though -- a mainstream host refuses links
// too, for a name that is taken or a tree it may not write to, and substituting
// there would quietly paper over a real error. So the directory is probed once
// to see whether it can hold a link at all, and the caller's error stands
// wherever it can.
//
// What it substitutes depends on where the link was going:
//
// - A bin entry becomes a JavaScript launcher that hands off to the package's
//   own file by absolute path. A plain copy will not do: these files load
//   their implementation relatively (`require('../lib/cli.js')`), and a copy
//   sitting in `.bin` would resolve that against the wrong directory. A
//   launcher also satisfies both of its consumers -- it reads as JavaScript
//   for `node <entry>`, and its `#!` line makes it executable for `npm run`.
// - Anything else becomes a copy of the target, a directory one recursively.
//
// Both are reported as success: from npm's side the entry is now there, which
// is all it asked for.
