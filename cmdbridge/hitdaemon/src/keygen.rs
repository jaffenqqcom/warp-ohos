//! Key generation and serialization for the daemon SSH server.
//!
//! Two keypairs are involved at startup:
//! - a freshly generated **dynamic** host key and client keypair for the
//!   command listener (both regenerated on every daemon run, never persisted),
//!   and
//! - a **fixed** management host key plus the authorized management client
//!   public key, generated once at build time and shipped in this crate's conf
//!   directory (the management side; the client keeps the matching halves).
