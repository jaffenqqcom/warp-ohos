//! Preloads that repair host defects in the programs this daemon spawns.
//!
//! Two files ship inside the daemon's own package, in `<pkg>/shim/` beside
//! `bin/` and `conf/`. Because they travel in the package, the system installs
//! them and replaces them on every reinstall, and nothing at runtime writes,
//! checks or heals a copy of its own.
//!
//! [`install`] resolves that directory from the package root -- see
//! `crate::package_root` -- and exports the two variables that make every later
//! child carry the preloads. Both consumers read their variable from the
//! environment at exec time, so the preloads reach command exec, PTY shells and
//! any spawn site added later without a per-call hook.
//!
//! - `NODE_OPTIONS=--require <pkg>/shim/shim.js`. The script's own header
//!   details what it repairs; in short, an OHOS app runs under a uid no account
//!   database entry covers, so `os.userInfo()` throws `ERR_SYSTEM_ERROR`,
//!   `process.platform` is reported as `openharmony`, which tooling that
//!   switches on it treats as fatal, and the install tree's filesystem refuses
//!   symlinks, which stops `npm install` when it builds `node_modules/.bin`.
//! - `LD_PRELOAD=<pkg>/shim/musllib-shim.so`. The platform's libc caps pthread
//!   keys at `PTHREAD_KEYS_MAX` (128) per process, and the
//!   `aarch64-unknown-linux-ohos` target does not enable native thread-local
//!   storage, so Rust's std implements `thread_local!` on top of those keys --
//!   one key per variable in the whole process. Any program that loads enough
//!   Rust code at once (a language server, a build) therefore runs out of keys
//!   and aborts with "out of TLS keys". The preload interposes the pthread TLS
//!   entry points and serves a virtual key space from a single real key, which
//!   removes the ceiling for every process it is loaded into.
//!
//! A preload that is absent is reported and left out of the environment rather
//! than named in it: both consumers treat an unusable entry as fatal to their
//! own startup -- the loader refuses an `LD_PRELOAD` it cannot open, and Node
//! refuses a `--require` naming a missing file -- which is worse than the
//! defects this works around.
//!
//! Only the OHOS build ships the payload: both defects are properties of the
//! OHOS runtime, and the guest runs a full Linux userland that exhibits
//! neither. The guest build therefore finds an empty directory and carries on.
//! No preload is required for the daemon to serve: nothing here returns an
//! error, and every unusable preload is reported and skipped the same way a
//! missing one is.
