//! Fixed-key management SSH listener (127.0.0.1:40230).
//!
//! hitshell connects here with its fixed management key, authenticates with
//! the fixed client public key, and sends the reserved `BOOTSTRAP_COMMAND`
//! command to receive this run's `SshInfo` (the dynamic command host key +
//! client private key + command port). Each daemon restart regenerates the
//! dynamic keys, so the command listener the client is handed is always the
//! current one.
//!
//! The connection is long-lived rather than one poll per connection: the client
//! holds it open for as long as its process runs and re-sends the request over
//! it whenever it needs the keys. Its presence is therefore what says the
//! instance is still there, and its end is what says the instance is gone (see
//! `peers`) -- so nothing here retires a client on a timer.
//!
//! The client appends the directory it works in, which this side adopts for the
//! programs it spawns -- see `session_tmp`. That is the only
//! path by which the daemon learns the directory: it runs under its own account
//! and cannot read the host application's environment, so the request has to
//! carry it.
