//! Command execution for the daemon's SSH exec channels.
//!
//! Every exec request runs `sh -c <command>` as its own process-group leader
//! (`process_group(0)`, so pid == pgid). A global in-memory session table maps
//! each client-chosen session id to the group leader pid, keyed by the client
//! identity it belongs to; `peers` mirrors those groups so a client that goes
//! away takes its whole tree with it. Signaling a running group goes through
//! the reserved command `SIGNAL_PREFIX <session_id> <signal>`, intercepted here
//! rather than spawned. Stdout is bridged to the channel's Data stream and
//! stderr to ExtendedData; the exit status is reported over exit-status, and a
//! signal-killed child over exit-signal.
//!
//! The stdio bridge keeps BOTH directions open until the child actually exits:
//! a long-lived LSP server (clangd) reads its stdin and writes its stdout for
//! the whole session, so the SSH channel must not close either direction on a
//! transient condition. Only `child.wait()` completion ends the bridge.
